Since the first time I had the chance to\n        open a Netscape Navigator browser in the 90's, still a student at the\n        time, I wanted to find out what this 'internet' was all about. Then and\n        there I chose to dedicate my newly born professional life to develop web\n        projects.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"mb-3 sm:mb-4 md:mb-8 lg:mb-8 text-justify\">\n        Lots of things have happened since then. Born in Peru and now living in\n        Argentina, from working on small html sites to plan, construct and\n        maintain enterprise SPA frontend projects, I have always find a way to\n        renew my passion for code. Exploring open source technologies like LAMP,\n        CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript frameworks as AngularJS or React, I have spent\n        as many hours building products as accumulating experience with new\n        tools and technologies... and loving every minute of it.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"mb-3 sm:mb-4 md:mb-8 lg:mb-8 text-justify\">\n        As I grew professionally I learned to work with a team around me,\n        balance our skills, seniority and those small and big quirks every human\n        have to provide better synergy for our common goals. Eventually I lead\n        teams, started to deal with internal customers - managers, bosses,\n        owners - and external ones - in behalf of my company and team - and got\n        the \"Technical Leader\" monicker even before it existed.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"mb-3 sm:mb-4 md:mb-8 lg:mb-8 text-justify\">\n        This site provides a better way to list my skills and describe my\n        experiences. It also gives an example of what I do at the moment as the\n        code is available in my github. If you feel like my profile fits your\n        business needs, contact me, let's talk.\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"font-bold text-right text-base sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl\">\n        Hector\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default React.memo(About);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
