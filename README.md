hector-site.herokuapp.com source code

Hi, this is the source code for my personal website. These are the reasons why it exists:

1. A site where I can show a detailed version of my resume and examples of things I can build.

2. As a reference of things I have been building with React and related libraries/technologies. I have a repository with easy examples of stuff I can reuse on other projects.

3. A public repository on Github to show code I create. I have been involved on many web projects, but the code was always propietary. This way I can give a small example of what I develop these days.

Any questions, work proposals or Pull Requests please contact me at hpizarro@gmail.com
